            <h1>What is M-CHAT™?</h1>

            <p>The M-CHAT is validated for screening toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, to assess risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The M-CHAT can be administered and scored as part of a well-child check-up, and also can be used by specialists
                or other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of the M-CHAT was to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children
                who score at risk for ASD will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, M-CHAT have developed a structured follow-up interview for use in conjunction with the M-CHAT; it is available at the two websites listed above. Users should be aware
                that even with the follow-up questions, a significant number of the children who fail the M-CHAT will not be diagnosed with an ASD; however, these children are at risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation
                is warranted for any child who fails the screening.<br/><br/>The M-CHAT can be scored in less than two minutes. Scoring instructions can be downloaded from http://www.mchatscreen.com or www.firstsigns.org. We also have developed a scoring
                template, which is available on these websites; when printed on an overhead transparency and laid over the completed M-CHAT, it facilitates scoring. Please note that minor differences in printers may cause your scoring template not to
                line up exactly with the printed M-CHAT. Children who fail 3 or more items total or 2 or more critical items (particularly if these scores remain elevated after the M-CHAT Follow-up Interview) should be referred for diagnostic evaluation
                by a specialist trained to evaluate ASD in very young children. In addition, children for whom there are physician, parent, or other professional’s concerns about ASD should be referred for evaluation, given that it is unlikely for any
                screening instrument to have 100% sensitivity.</p>

            <h4>Instructions and Permissions for Use of the M-CHAT</h4>
            <p>The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT; Robins, Fein, & Barton, 1999) is available for free download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. There are two authorized websites: the M- CHAT and supplemental materials
                can be downloaded from www.firstsigns.org or from Dr. Robins’ website, at http://www.mchatscreen.com Users should be aware that the M-CHAT continues to be studied, and may be revised in the future. Any revisions will be posted to the two
                websites noted above. Furthermore, the M-CHAT is a copyrighted instrument, and use of the M-CHAT must follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reprints/reproductions of the M-CHAT must include the copyright at the bottom ( 1999 Robins, Fein, & Barton). No modifications can be made to items, instructions, or item order without permission from the authors.</li>
                <li>The M-CHAT must be used in its entirety. There is no evidence that using a subset of items will be valid.</li>
                <li>(3) Parties interested in reproducing the M-CHAT in print (e.g., a book or journal article) or electronically for use by others (e.g., as part of digital medical record or other software packages) must contact Diana Robins to request permission
                    (mchatscreen2009@gmail.com).
                </li>
                <li> If you are part of a medical practice, and you want to incorporate the M-CHAT into your own practice’s electronic medical record (EMR), you are welcome to do so. However, if you ever want to distribute your EMR page outside of your practice,
                    please contact Diana Robins to request permission.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Scoring</h4>
            The current recommended scoring algorithm is as follows:

            <ul>
                <li>M-CHAT Total Score 0-2: No Follow-Up necessary. If child is younger than 24 mos, screen again at 24 mos (or after 3 mos has elapsed). Continue developmental surveillance.</li>
                <li>M-CHAT Total Score 3-6: M-CHAT/F is important to evaluate risk. If child continues to score 3 or higher, refer immediately for clinical evaluation and to determine eligibility for early intervention services. Please note, if Follow-Up
                    score is 2 monitor carefully, since child may need referral.</li>
                <li>M-CHAT Total Score 7-23: Child is at risk for ASD or other developmental delays. It is acceptable to refer immediately without completing the M-CHAT Follow-Up.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Disclaimer:</b> The M-CHAT was developed to be completed by parents of children 16-30 months. If it is used in ways others than intended, one cannot interpret the findings. For example, if used on children younger or older than the
                age range on which it was validated, or if completed by someone other than a child’s parent, the results may not be valid.
