    <p>This is not a medical treatment study. The primary goal of the M-CHAT was to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk
        for ASD will be diagnosed with ASD. <br/> <br/>We take great care to protect your privacy. However, if there is a data breach it may be possible to identify you. This risk is low but it is not zero. <br/> <br/> Participating in this study as parent
        or relative may generate a wide range of emotions. It could affect your mood. <br/> <br/> Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told of any new information that might change your decision to
        be in this study.</p>
