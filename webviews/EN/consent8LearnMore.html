    <p>The M-CHAT is validated for screening toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, to assess risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The M-CHAT can be administered and scored as part of a well-child check-up, and also can be used by specialists or
        other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of the M-CHAT was to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score
        at risk for ASD will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, M-CHAT have developed a structured follow-up interview for use in conjunction with the M-CHAT; it is available at the two websites listed above. Users should be aware that even with
        the follow-up questions, a significant number of the children who fail the M-CHAT will not be diagnosed with an ASD; however, these children are at risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation is warranted for any
        child who fails the screening.<br/><br/>The M-CHAT can be scored in less than two minutes. Scoring instructions can be downloaded from http://www.mchatscreen.com or www.firstsigns.org. We also have developed a scoring template, which is available
        on these websites; when printed on an overhead transparency and laid over the completed M-CHAT, it facilitates scoring. Please note that minor differences in printers may cause your scoring template not to line up exactly with the printed M-CHAT.
        Children who fail 3 or more items total or 2 or more critical items (particularly if these scores remain elevated after the M-CHAT Follow-up Interview) should be referred for diagnostic evaluation by a specialist trained to evaluate ASD in very
        young children. In addition, children for whom there are physician, parent, or other professionalâ€™s concerns about ASD should be referred for evaluation, given that it is unlikely for any screening instrument to have 100% sensitivity.</p>
